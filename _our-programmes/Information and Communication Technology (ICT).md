<p><strong>VISION</strong>
</p>
<p>Future Ready and Thoughtful Digital Learners</p>
<p><strong>MISSION</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop responsible learners who leverage technology for learning</p>
<p><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong>
</p>
<p>Educational technology is meaningfully integrated into the curriculum
to encourage the pupils to be actively engaged in their learning. During
the process, students learn to interact positively in cyberspace.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 1 and 2: Foundation Digital Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>Our youngest students learn basic computer skills including typing, mouse
control, and using common software like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.
They also begin using the Student Learning Space (SLS) and learn about
safe internet behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 3 and 4: Collaborative Digital Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Students advance to using online platforms like SLS and Padlet for group
work and interactive learning. They develop skills in digital communication
and online collaboration with classmates.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 5 and 6: Advanced Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>Upper primary students explore computational thinking through coding and
robotics. They learn about emerging technologies like generative AI and
smart robots, while understanding the importance of responsible technology
use.</p>
<p><strong>ICT Club: Digital Creation</strong>
</p>
<p>Club members work on exciting projects including robot programming, game
creation, and digital media production. These activities help develop both
technical skills and creativity.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Through Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) sessions and school activities,
students learn to be responsible digital citizens. We partner with parents
through talks and workshops to promote safe and positive use of technology.</p>
<p><em>All programmes are regularly updated to align with current technological developments.</em>
