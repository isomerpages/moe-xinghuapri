<p><strong>VISION</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop students as discerning readers and effective communicators.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION</strong>
</p>
<p>To create a vibrant and supportive environment where students build a
strong foundation in English through engaging and meaningful learning experiences.</p>
<p><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>STELLAR </strong>(Strategies for English Language Learning And
Reading)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Xinghua Primary School, the teaching of English Language is guided
by the STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading) which
is developed by the Ministry of Education. STELLAR aims to strengthen students’
language and literacy skills through the use of rich stories of different
themes and genres. Students learn to collaborate and work in groups, sharing
ideas with one another. By fostering a love for reading and providing opportunities
for listening, speaking, reading, and writing, STELLAR helps students become
confident and effective users of the English language. Through interactive
activities and age-appropriate texts, our students develop both foundational
skills and a lifelong appreciation for the language.</p>
<p><strong>Experiential Learning&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to the STELLAR programme, our school places strong emphasis
on experiential learning to make the English Language come alive for our
students. We believe that children learn best when they are actively involved
and can connect language to real-life experiences. Whether it’s observing
caterpillars transform into butterflies during a thematic unit or making
their own sandwiches while learning to write procedural texts, our students
engage in hands-on activities that make reading and writing meaningful,
relevant, and fun. These experiences not only deepen their understanding
of language structures but also spark curiosity and joy in learning.</p>
<p><strong>Joy of Reading&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe in nurturing a lifelong love for reading by creating joyful
and enriching reading experiences for all students. We offer a wide range
of reading programmes and activities to make reading both meaningful and
fun. From our collaboration with the National Library Board to bring in
MOLLY Bus (Mobile Library), to the creation of inviting reading spaces
around the school, we strive to make books accessible and appealing. Our
annual Reading Festival is a much-anticipated event where students dress
up as their favourite book characters and celebrate the magic of stories.
Structured programmes such as the Primary 1 and 2 Reading Programme and
our Buddy Reading Programme, where older students read with younger ones,
provide additional support and encouragement. Through these varied efforts,
we aim to instill in every child the joy and habit of reading.</p>
