<p><strong>Character Development: Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>At Xinghua, we believe in nurturing well-rounded individuals who are ready
to face life's challenges with confidence. Our Skills programme is thoughtfully
designed to help students develop essential life competencies through engaging,
age-appropriate activities.</p>
<p>Students will embark on a journey of self-discovery and growth through
lessons that focus on three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal effectiveness and well-being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building meaningful relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sound decisions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through interactive activities and guided discussions, students will learn
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand and manage their emotions effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build healthy friendships and work well with others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think critically and make responsible choices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop resilience and problem-solving skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With hands-on learning experiences and structured lessons, students learn
how to recognise and manage their emotions, interact positively with peers,
and make choices grounded in values. These early foundations set the stage
for resilient and compassionate individuals who are equipped to navigate
life’s challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Character Development: Catch Me Doing Good</strong>
</p>
<p>Every day, our students demonstrate remarkable acts of kindness, responsibility,
and excellence. Through our "Catch Me Doing Good" programme, we celebrate
these shining moments that reflect our school's core values.</p>
<p>Refer to the following table for our focus value(s) for each term.</p>

<p>We create exciting opportunities for students to be recognised when they
put these values into practice. What makes this recognition particularly
special is that it comes from both teachers and fellow students who notice
these positive actions in their daily interactions.</p>
<p>This program creates a positive ripple effect throughout our school community.
When students see their friends being recognized for good character, it
motivates them to reflect on and strengthen their own actions. It's heartwarming
to see how one good deed inspires another, creating a culture where positive
behaviour becomes second nature.</p>
<p><strong>Character Development: Growing Through Stories</strong>
</p>
<p>Stories have a magical way of teaching life's most important lessons.
Through our Growing Through Stories programme, your child will embark on
an enriching journey where carefully selected stories become windows to
understanding values, emotions, and relationships.</p>
<p>Each term, our students explore new stories that are thoughtfully chosen
to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inspire positive character development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurture a Growth Mindset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build empathy and understanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage reflection and discussion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During these engaging sessions, students will connect with characters
who face real-life challenges, learn valuable lessons about care, responsibility,
respect, and resilience, develop critical thinking skills through meaningful
discussions, and share their thoughts and experiences in a supportive environment</p>
<p>Through the power of storytelling, we're helping your child develop not
just as a student, but as a compassionate, thoughtful individual who understands
the importance of good values and positive relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Citizenship Education: National Education (NE) Commemorative Events</strong>
</p>
<p>NE Commemorative Events provide opportunities for our Xinghuazens to deepen
their appreciation of our shared past and reflect on how they have a role
to play in Singapore’s present and future.&nbsp;Our school believes in
creating memorable NE Commemorative Events, which truly engage our Xinghuazens
and adopts a whole school integrated approach in doing so.</p>

<p>Apart from our NE Commemorative Events, our Mother Tongue department oversee
ethnic festivals, i.e. Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, and Deepavali,
and designs educational and impactful learning opportunities that run alongside
the festivities.</p>
<p><strong>Citizenship Education: Values-in-Action</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Values in Action (VIA) programs provide meaningful opportunities for
students to put their values into practice and make a positive impact on
the world around them. Through carefully designed, age-appropriate activities,
students learn the value of responsibility, empathy, and initiative. Younger
students start by taking care of their personal and classroom spaces, while
older students are guided to take action beyond themselves — contributing
meaningfully to the school and wider community.</p>
<p>Programmes such as Clean As We Go (CAWG), VIA-in-CCA and Level VIA provide
hands-on opportunities for students to serve with heart and reflect on
their impact. More than just fulfilling a task, students are taught the
why behind their actions, helping them grow into gracious, community-minded
individuals.</p>
<p>We believe that when children experience the satisfaction of making a
positive difference, they develop a lifelong commitment to serving others.
Watch your child grow from taking care of their immediate environment to
becoming an active contributor to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Career Guidance: Xinghua Academy</strong>
</p>
<p>At Xinghua Primary, we believe that every child has the potential to shine.
Xinghua Academy is our structured talent development programme designed
to support students with the passion, aptitude, and aspiration to pursue
their interests further — both within and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Grounded in the belief that education is the gateway to a better future,
Xinghua Academy identifies and nurtures Primary 3 to 6 students who demonstrate
potential in academic and non-academic areas such as Science, the Arts,
leadership, and CCAs. Through enrichment programmes like E2K, Wits &amp;
Words, our students are guided to explore their strengths and grow their
talents.</p>
<p>For students considering the Direct School Admission (DSA) route, Xinghua
Academy provides dedicated mentoring and practical support — including
portfolio preparation, interview coaching, and skills development. We also
work closely with families to share clear information, address concerns,
and encourage confident decision-making.</p>
<p>With strong guidance, a thoughtful structure, and continuous encouragement,
Xinghua Academy opens doors for our students to pursue their dreams and
become confident, purpose-driven learners of the future.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Career Guidance: Education Guidance</strong>
</p>
<p>Every child’s journey is unique, and at Xinghua Primary, we are committed
to helping our students discover their strengths, aspirations, and future
possibilities. Our Education Guidance programme supports students — especially
those in the upper primary levels — in understanding the diverse educational
pathways available to them and finding purpose in their learning.</p>
<p>Anchored in the belief that there are many paths to success, the program
is designed to provide our students with the knowledge and motivation they
need to make informed decisions about their educational journey. As part
of our dedicated P6 Transition Programme aptly named X-plore, X-perience,
X-cite (X3), we explore different pathways including holding secondary
school talks and secondary school experiential visits to spark students’
curiosity and provide them with a target to work towards, motivating them
to work hard not just for the sake of it, but with a clear sense of purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Career Guidance: Careers Exploration</strong>
</p>
<p>Every child wonders, "What will I be when I grow up?" Our Career Exploration
programme opens windows to exciting possibilities, helping students discover
the vast world of career opportunities that await them.</p>
<p>Through age-appropriate platforms such as Careers Talks at Primary 5 and
our exciting World of Work (WoW!) Day at Primary 6, students engage in
meaningful conversations with professionals from diverse fields. These
sessions open their eyes to a wide range of industries and career paths,
helping them connect classroom learning to real-world applications.</p>
<p>Understanding the unique backgrounds and experiences of our students,
we are intentional in showcasing a diverse mix of relatable role models
— people who inspire, encourage, and affirm that success comes in many
forms. By sharing stories of perseverance, passion, and purpose, we help
students dream big and believe in what they can become.</p>
<p>With strong community partnerships and a heart for every child, our Career
Exploration programme is about more than jobs — it’s about nurturing aspirations
and showing our Xinghuazens that their future is full of possibilities.</p>
