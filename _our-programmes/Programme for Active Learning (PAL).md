**Background Information**
  
PAL was introduced to schools in the Primary 1 and 2 curriculum after a review by the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee in 2009 to address the need for greater emphasis on non-academic programmes.  
  
PAL was conceptualised to achieve the following objectives:  

*   Provide pupils with broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities in two broad areas - Sports &amp; Games and Outdoor Education and Performing Arts (Music and Dance) and Visual Arts.  
    
*   Facilitate holistic development of pupils in the 5 domains, that is, moral, cognitive, physical, social and aesthetics  
    
*   Provide varied avenues for pupils to develop social and emotional competencies  
    

  
The two broad areas of Sports &amp; Games and Outdoor Education, and Performing Arts and Visual Arts are selected as they provide:  
  

*   Platforms for experiential learning: experimentation, exploration and achieving success; and  
    
*   Opportunities for learning experiences to acquire a range of skills as well as interaction with their peers, thereby developing confidence (3Cs – Confidence, Curiosity, Cooperation Skills)  
    

  
Collectively, PAL modules will enhance the total experience of pupils in primary schools in the moral, physical, aesthetics, social and emotional domains of learning for a holistic education.  
  
**Uniquely Xinghua PAL**

In Xinghua Primary School, PAL is designed under the theme of The World and its Cultural Diversity. The rationale is to create an awareness among our pupils the different cultures in the world by exposing them to the different art forms, cuisines, dance, sports, songs, musical instruments, animals, sports, climate and terrains while cultivating the 21st Century Competencies (eg. Confidence, Curiosity, Cooperation) and developing the Social-Emotional Competencies.

**Sports and Games**  
Pupils experience a wide range of sports and games from various countries such as Tennis (France), Sepak Takraw (Malaysia), Rugby (England) and Basketball (USA). Through sports and games, students build up on their competencies in teamwork, communication and interpersonal relationship.  
  
**Visual Arts**  
Pupils are exposed to two different art forms of creating homes and community. Through the use of various shapes and colours, pupils come together to build a communal living space. Pupils also experience problem-solving, decision-making and group presentation  
  
**Performing Arts (Music)**  
Pupils are introduced to different genres of music like folk, nursery rhyme and classical that span from Africa to Australia to Germany. With the music around the world, pupils learn to appreciate the diversity of the country's culture and its music. Through the different activities and playing of instruments, pupils learn to work together to make music and build up their self-management and relationship management skills.  
  
**Outdoor Education**  
Pupils learn about the different flora and fauna found in other countries and the different climates experienced by people of different nations. As pupils learn to use their senses to connect with their environment, they also participate in interesting outdoor activities such&nbsp;as “rowing” on scooters, flying a kite and pitching a tent.  
  
**Performing Arts (Dance)**  
Pupils have an opportunity to learn folk dances from around the world. Japanese, Korean, Indian, Bangra, Malay and Chinese dance were just some of the many that they learnt and performed in class. The cultural exposure to these dances leads students to learn about diversity and respecting different cultures.
