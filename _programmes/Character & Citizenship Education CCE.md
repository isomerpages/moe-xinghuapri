# **VISION**  
Thoughtful citizen 

# **Mission**  
Nurture students to be self-regulated individuals who make responsible decision for personal well-being and for the good of others.  
  
# **KEY PROGRAMMES**  
The school adopted a holistic approach to CCE which involves explicit teaching of CCE knowledge, skills, and values in CCE lessons. There are multiple learning platforms and opportunities created to help students to internalise values, social -emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions.  
  
**Positive About Self**
*   New U  
    A one-week activity filled orientation programme to set tone for the year. During this time, teachers guide the students to set expectation for personal effectiveness and well-being before academic learning starts. This is also the time to build relationship with teachers and peers in the class through interactive activities. 

*   Make Good Character Visible  
    Positive emotions are fostered through affirmation of students’ exemplary good characters.

**Values in Action**
*   Everyday Responsibility  
    Our students develop a sense of responsibility and care for their own shared spaces. 
		
*   VIVA @ Xinghua  
    An initiative to develop the spirit of volunteerism in our students. Students are given opportunity to volunteer their time or talent to assist teachers in project work.  
		
*   Everyday Responsibility  
    Our students develop a sense of responsibility and care for their own shared spaces. 
		
**Sense of Belonging**
*   CCE in House System  
    Our school House System weave in CCE when planning for House activities and House meetings to reinforce resilience and strengthen peer relationship in the school community. The positive peer relationship develops students’ sense of belongings.

House Meeting 1: Buddy Up<br>
House Meeting 2: Care for our community<br>
House Meeting 3: Creativity<br>


*   Learning Beyond Classroom  
    Students develop a sense of belongings as they walk through the memory lanes of the past. We visited Kallang Heritage Walk @ Singapore Sports Hub, Yip Yew Chong’s wall mural at Changi Terminal 4 to understand the history and heritage of Singapore and to appreciate the contribution of our forefathers in the development of our nation.

**Student Leadership**

Student leaders are empowered to promote peer support through helping and bonding with other students, and to be influencers of positive behaviour to provide a more caring and enabling school environment.

There are various platforms for them to put the knowledge of social skills and values into practice:
* Share their voices based on the scenario-based discussions, role plays and debates during the customised leadership
trainings and focus-group discussions.
* Facilitate the Friend-of-Singa project, titled ‘Values Through Play’.
* Embark on the Intergenerational Learning Programme where they will bond with the seniors.
* Plan Teachers’ Day celebration.
