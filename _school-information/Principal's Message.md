Dear everyone

Welcome back to Xinghua in 2023. 

To students and staff who have just joined Xinghua this year, a very warm welcome to our family! In Xinghua, you will experience a Caring and Enabling Environment that nurtures all students.  In Xinghua, we do our best to nurture and help every student, no matter where he or she comes from, or how high or low is one’s ability and motivation.  If a student needs help, we always aim to develop him or her to be the best he or she can be. In Xinghua, we enable our students with knowledge (and skills) and empower them with courage (and positive attitudes and right values).

Since late 2021, we spoke with teachers and non-teaching staff, students and also parents about a vision for Xinghua in the coming years. By end of last year, we have confirmed the vision of the school, after gathering feedback from the different stakeholders and also looking through some of the data and information concerning our school.  The  <b>vision of Xinghua</b> for the next 3 years (2023 to 2025) will be:

<center> <b>Resilient Achievers, Thoughtful Citizens</b> </center>

In addition to the current set of school values (<b>Excellence, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility</b>), we have also included the value of <b>Care</b>.  The <b>mission of Xinghua Primary</b> is on <b>Providing a Caring and Enabling Environment for all Students</b>. 

In the coming months, we will communicate more details about the Vision, Values and the school’s Mission to our students, their families, our community partners and the general community.

Being a Resilient Achiever and a Thoughtful Citizen are important qualities that we value and cultivate at our school. Resilience involves the ability to persevere and bounce back from challenges as one strives for Excellence in Learning and Achievement, while being a Thoughtful Citizen involves being aware of and actively contributing to the well-being of others and the community.

At our school, we encourage all students to set goals for themselves and work towards achieving them, even when faced with setbacks. We also encourage our students to be active and engaged members of their community, both in and out of school.

We believe that developing resilience and citizenship are essential skills that will serve our students well not only in their academic pursuits, but also in their personal and professional lives.

We encourage all members of our school community, including students, parents, and staff, to model resilience and citizenship for our young people. By setting a good example and demonstrating these values in our own lives, we can help to create a positive and supportive school culture for students and staff of Xinghua Primary School.
