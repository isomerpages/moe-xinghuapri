<p>Thank you for your interest in Xinghua Primary School.</p>
<p>In 1930, our founder, Mr Chua Cheok San, founded Sing Hua Public School
because he had a dream to give the children in the village a better life
through education. Our very first school building was a wood-and-thatch
building he rented. Subsequently, the school moved several times due to
an increasing enrolment. After the war, Mr Chua did not give up despite
a major setback when the school building was converted into a soap factory.
With the support of well wishes and sponsors in the community, the school
was able to expand again. Mr Chua sadly passed on in 1949, but his son,
Mr Chua Tiah Seng, carried on his good work.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, Xinghua Primary School braved several difficult
periods and emerged stronger each time and this Xinghua spirit is encapsulated
in its old school song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Embrace the spirit of challenge,
<br>Nurture the passion for learning,
<br>We’ve good teachers to guide us,
<br>We’ve good friends to support us,
<br>Onwards we will strive!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, my team and I are humbled and united by a sense of duty to realize
our founder’s vision and continue his resilient spirit. Xinghua Primary
School now stands as a cornerstone of education in Hougang which strives
to <u>nurture our students into resilient achievers and thoughtful citizens</u>.</p>
<p>True to our school values of Care, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience
and Excellence (CARE), our team pledges to develop <u>a caring and enabling school environment</u>,
empowering students to be respectful, responsible and resilient individuals
who constantly strive for excellence.</p>
<p>As we continue this journey, we are deeply grateful for your continued
support and well wishes. Together, we can scale greater heights.</p>
<p>Towards Excellence, Xinghua!</p>
<p>
